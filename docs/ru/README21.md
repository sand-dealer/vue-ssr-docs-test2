# About GitLocalize

## What is GitLocalize? <a id="what-is-gitlocalize"></a>

[O GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/) é uma plataforma de localização contínua e automatizada que simplifica o fluxo de trabalho de tradução para desenvolvedores.

Projects are always changing, and keeping them localized can be a daunting (and annoying) challenge. We realized this and decided that there should be a way to streamline this. GitLocalize connects to your GitHub repository and seamlessly integrates with your development workflow in just a few clicks.
